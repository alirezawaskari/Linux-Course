# Introduction

## What's Linux and Where does it come from?

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software in many distributions, causing some controversy.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)

We'll get to know all the difficult words in upcoming chapters.

{% hint style="info" %}
This Course is based on the combination of "Linux+" by CompTIA, "Linux Essentials" and "LPIC-1" by LPI standards, and the name "Linux++" comes from here. This Guide is the reference to our course and is designed to be comprehensive, for those who lose instructions, and to be simple to understand for those who have lack of experience and knowledge in this area.
